## �� DESCRIPTION
​
### �� What is it about?
​
The motive behind this project was to fully understand how to use APIs within our own work. We created a app which used 2 API and pulled data
and displayed the data through a clean UI. The motivation behind the project to share knowledge about space exploration and provide an engaging way for people to learn about space. The website solves the problem of scattered space-related information by consolidating it into a single place with a modern and easy-to-use interface.

### �� What I've learnt
​
By creating the Space API website, I have  gained a variety of technical and non-technical skills. On the technical side, I have learned how to use APIs to access and display data, how to code a website with a clean and modern UI, and how to debug and troubleshoot issues that arised. I gained experience in working with web development tools and languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the non-technical side, I improved my problem-solving and project management skills, as well as your ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with others. 
​
### ➕ Suggestions for improvement
​
- Could create a dark/light mode for the site
- Could have space themed cursour
- Could have space noises playing when the site is deplolyed
